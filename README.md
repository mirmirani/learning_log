  <h1>Django: Learning Log</h1>
  <h5> 
    What is it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Learning Log is a personal journal jotter for anything you are learning which can be accessed online from anywhere. It allows you to make a personal user account and add topics and entries to record your learning.

    <h5> 
    How was it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Creating this app was a good experience in getting to know more about the MVC model and OOP principles. It was eye-opening to learn how powerful of a framework Django really is and the capabilities of python.
    </p>
    <p>
    I ran into some bugs but Django comes with a very powerful debugging tool and I was able to overcome them by using Django’s documentation and stackoverflow. 
    </p>
    <h5>
     Future steps
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Django’s templating tool is indeed very powerful but I hope to get more familiar with using and customising widgets in the future. I also hope to learn CMS Wagtail for more smoother admin integration.
